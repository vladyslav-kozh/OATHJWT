# OATHJWT

This GitHub repository demonstrates the implementation of OAuth and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication in a C# web application. OAuth allows users to securely grant limited access to their resources without revealing their credentials, while JWT serves as a compact, self-contained token for authentication and authorization.

Features
OAuth Integration: Configure OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) to enable user authentication through trusted identity providers.

JWT Authentication: Implement JWT authentication to secure your application's endpoints and resources.
